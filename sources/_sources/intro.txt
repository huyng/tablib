Philosphy
---------

Tablib was developed with a few `The Zen of Python`_ idioms in mind.

#. Explicit is better than implicit.
#. Simple is better than complex.
#. Complex is better than complicated.
#. Readability counts.

MIT License
-----------

A large number of open source projects you find today are `GPL Licensed`_. While the GPL certianly has essential applications, it should most certianly not be your go-to license for you next open source project. 

A project that was released as GPL cannot be usd in any commercial product without the product itself also being offered as open source. The MIT and BSD licenses are fantastic alternatives to this *major* problem. 

Tablib is released under terms of `The MIT License`_.
